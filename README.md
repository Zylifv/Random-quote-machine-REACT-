# Random-quote-machine-REACT-
A random quote machine of Simpsons quotes using REACT

My first project using REACT as part of FreeCodeCamps certifications.

The REACT libraries used are:

https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/19.0.0/cjs/react-dom.production.min.js
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.13.0/react.min.js

This uses a Simpsons random quote API which can be found here:

All credit for the API goes to its coder - Jason Luboff
